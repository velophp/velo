BUG:
- duplicating a row with files in it will not copy the files from original row, hence pointing to the same file
- errors may appear after updating collection fields order --doesn't break functionality

IMPROVEMENT:
- refactor file handling
- add auto generate thumbnail feature for created lifecycle
- add whereIn record query compiler for efficient filterings
